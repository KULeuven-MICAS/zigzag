# üåÄ ZigZag Tutorial Series

Welcome to the ZigZag tutorial series! This series of labs will guide you through the key concepts and functionalities of the ZigZag framework for HW Architecture-Mapping Design Space Exploration (DSE) for Deep Learning (DL) accelerators.

## üåü Overview

ZigZag bridges the gap between algorithmic DL decisions and their acceleration cost on specialized hardware, providing fast and accurate HW cost estimation. Through its advanced mapping engines, ZigZag automates the discovery of optimal mappings for complex DL computations on custom architectures.
